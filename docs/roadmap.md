# Roadmap

Each phase ends in something runnable.

1. **Spec.** Formal grammar for loose syntax. Exact syntax for tempering annotations, pause markers, and the shared-lock keyword. Precise enough to write a parser.
2. **Vertical slice.** Parser and type inferencer in Rust for a small subset (functions, numbers, strings, lists, control flow). Interpreter first, to prove the loose syntax feels right.
3. **Native backend.** Cranelift (decided). Generate native code for the subset. Benchmark against Python.
4. **Core differentiators.** Ownership inference, borrow checking, tempering, exception-to-Result error lowering. The hardest phase.
5. **Ecosystem.** Python typed bridge, Rust binary-level interop, unified package tool (one manifest, one lockfile), concurrency.

Concurrency and interop come last because they depend on everything beneath them.

Gut estimate: phases 1-3 (a prototype) about a quarter; a language trusted for real work, one to two years.
